# EDF (Earliest Deadline First)
This project is my attempt at learning the basics of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), which allows developers to
create an Android and an iOS app from a single codebase.

This is a simple To-Do list app, which allows one to create To-Do items with an attached deadline, and orders the list
in an earliest-deadline-first fashion.
